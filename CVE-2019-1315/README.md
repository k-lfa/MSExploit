You will need the NtApiDotNet library to run it, as well as a valid Report.wer file, both to be placed in the same directory as the poc.ps1 script.

To generate a WER report file, you can run the [Environment]::FailFast('Error') command in PowerShell, and look for the report file in %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportQueue.

The script can be run with the following command:

powershell -exec bypass -C ". .\poc.ps1; Test-Exploit"
